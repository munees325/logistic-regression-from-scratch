# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Project Description
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy.
No machine learning libraries are used for model building.

## Concepts Used
- Sigmoid Function
- Gradient Descent
- Binary Classification
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Dataset
Binary classification dataset from Kaggle.

## Outcome
Custom Logistic Regression model works similar to scikit-learn model.
